   <h2>Brooklyn, Where New York City Begins!


</h2>
   <h3> By Kelsie Rivera</h3>

   <p class="uno">Manhattan might be best known for its towering skyscrapers and bustling pavement, but there are few New York City locales more loved than the 843 acres of green that is Central Park.
   Stretching from Midtown to Harlem, the park is a year-round natural oasis for locals and visitors alike.
   With the city’s population ballooning in the mid-19th century, the New York State Legislature set aside a large swath of land to create a much-needed public park. After winning a design contest in 1858, landscape architects Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux were tasked with bringing to life what Olmsted called “the lungs of the city.”
   The park has changed and evolved over the century and a half since then to become what it is today: a diverse public space encompassing forest paths, ponds and fountains, performance spaces and long, dreamy stretches of green. And the latest change came in June 2018 when the park became automobile-free.</p>

   <p class="uno">   Upon the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge, it cost 1 penny to walk across and even went up to 5 pennies. Luckily that fee was waived, and you no longer have to pay to access the bridge. You can walk across the bridge which is only 1 mile long, 24 hours a day, completely free of charge. Also, there is no toll fee for driving on the Brooklyn Bridge. As one of New York City’s most iconic attractions it is highly encouraged for all who can to experience it and take advantage of the amazing views that it gives access to such as The Statue of Liberty! That’s right, you can see the beautiful Statue of Liberty from the Brooklyn Bridge. It is important to note that there are two paths and the one on the right is for pedestrians and the path on the left is for bicycles. The Brooklyn Bridge can be accessed from Brooklyn and Manhattan, see information below on how to get there. </p>
