    <p class="contenido1"> "One of my favourite places on earth is Central Park. I know there are so many other beautiful sights in the world, but for some reason there's something about this park that has captured my heart. I can't believe it's already been a year since I spent 2 months in NYC thinking and reflecting a lot in this special place.

In this weeks Central Park VLOG I'm excited to share my favourite people watching spot, where I sought cover from the rain, my refuge when I felt anxious, and my favourite reading nook!

There are so many amazing things to see in Central Park, but these places I'm about to share with you hold great meaning to me. I hope one day you're able to visit and enjoy them as much as I do"
